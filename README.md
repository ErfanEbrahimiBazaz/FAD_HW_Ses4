#Intro

In this repository masking webcam and steganography are covered.

In steganography I embed a text message in an image by putting into the lowest significant bit of every byte in the image. Later I embed a whole image inside another image and retreive it by bitwise operation.

In masking I swap my face from webcam frames with a face detected in an image.
